# Convolutional Neural Network trained on Satellite Data

I used Keras and Tensorflow to create the model, which I trained on the attached dataset containing a variety of satellite images. The model categorized the images as "green_area", "water", "desert", or "cloudy" (in the case that cloud cover prevented the model from being able to categorize the image correctly)
